Puzzle Minefield is a classic puzzle solving game, with enhancements such as cross-platform gameplay, and online progress tracking, but chiefly: Competitive Multiplayer
gameplay. Play head to head with others in random matches for ranks and to climb the leaderboard, or host your own server and invite friends / strangers to play with you, through LAN or online gameplay.

It's easy to learn how to play! There are only 3 different controls you need to know, Left Click, Right Click, and Middle Click. Enjoy playing through and honing your skills by competing against others online. Although it's easy to learn, it's difficult to master with increasingly skilled players facing you and more difficult maps 
to solve.

Enjoy the custom graphics and sound design, with interchangeable resource packs available, pick your favorite skin and enjoy a whole new experience playing with it.

<b>Device Specifications:</b>
<br>
Currently, Puzzle Minefield is most graphically stable on Windows 10 PCs, with 1920x1080p monitors. For other aspect ratios or resolutions, you may experience visual bugs. For operating systems other than Windows 10, you might experience issues with running the game. (Although in theory it should natively support any desktop computer)
<br>
A graphical support update is scheduled, check our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PuzzleMinefield/">reddit page</a> for updates.

<b>Please Notice:</b>
<br>
Any release pre-dating the latest release is deprecated. Deprecated releases are too outdated to play on Official or Community hosted online servers. Deprecated versions can still play solo games, and can still play on LAN or community servers of the same version. It is highly recommended that you update your version to the latest release, for stability, security, and maximum compatibility.
<br>
Additionally, all versions prior to Beta 1.0.0 will not support any networking capabilities, since they use our outdated pyroneon.ml domain. For archive reasons, we will not pull the old versions from the revision history, however, they will not have full function as intended.
